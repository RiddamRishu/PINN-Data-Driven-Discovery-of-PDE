# PINN-Data-Driven-Discovery-of-PDE
Pinn Neural Networks are constrained to respect any symmetries, invariances, or conservation principles originating from the physical laws that govern the observed data, as modeled by general time-dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations. 

The neural network is fabricated with encoding structured information (prior information like physical laws, empirically validated rules or other domain expertise and can be described in form of partial differential equations) into a learning algorithm. It results in amplifying the information content of the data that the algorithm sees, enabling it to quickly steer itself towards the right solution and generalize well even when only a few training examples are available. 

In this project, PINN to approximate a function along with learning unknown constants of the governing PDE is demonstrated using example of Navier Stokes Equation.
